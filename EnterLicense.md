# Entering your License Key

When you first start LightBurn you will be prompted to enter your license key or start your trial version. If you do not have a license key you can click the *Start your Free Trial* button to begin your 30-day unrestricted trial of the software.

If you have your license key, enter it in the License Key box and click the *Activate License* button.

Once you enter and activate a valid license key you will be prompted to restart LightBurn for the license to take effect.

# Menu Commands

If you don't know what a button / option does, hover the mouse over it. Tool-tips are often added to help in explaining them better.

If a button doesn't seem to do anything or ever enable, it's probably a feature that's not written or connected yet.  There are a few of those - there is only one developer working on the coding at the moment.

The toolbars and windows can all be dragged around if you don't like the layout.  Whatever you end up with is saved when you quit.

## File Menu 

### New
Clicking "New" in the File Menu will clear any current project and create a new one.
You can also press "Ctrl + N" (Command + N on Mac).

### Open recent projects
This will open a list of the most recently opened files to choose from.

### Open
To open an existing or saved file, click on “Open” in the File menu or press "Ctrl + O" (Command + O on Mac).

### Import
You can import any supported LightBurn files into the file you are currently working on. Click on “Import” in the File menu or press “Ctrl – I” LightBurn supports importing the following file types: svg, ai, pdf, dxf, hpgl, plt, png, jpg, bmp.

### Save
To save a project click on “Save” in the File menu or press "Ctrl + S".  Type the name you want the file saved as in the dialog box that opens up. To save a file with changes, but still keep the original file intact, click on the “Save As” icon in the File menu.

### Export
To export a file to a different file format, click on “Export” in the File menu. LightBurn can export to SVG or AI format, though bitmaps and text are currently not exported.

### Exit 
To exit LightBurn, click on the “Exit" in the File menu or press “Ctrl – Q”.  You will be prompted to save your file if you have unsaved changes.

## Edit Menu

### Undo
To undo the last editing action done on the current file, click on "Undo" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + Z".
### Redo
To Redo the last editing action done on the current file, click on "Redo" in the Edit menu or press "Shift + Ctrl + Z".
### Select all
To select all objects in the current file click on "Select all" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + A" (or Command + A on Mac).
### Cut
To one or more objects from the current file, select them and click on "Cut" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + X". This will put the object on the clipboard, and remove it from the current file.
### Copy
To copy one or more objects, select them and click "Copy" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + C" This will put the objects on the clipboard, but leave the original object alone.
### Duplicate
To duplicate a selection in place, select one or more objects and click "Duplicate" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + D".  This is an "in-place" copy and paste operation all in one, bypassing the clipboard.
This means if you already have something on the clipboard, it'll still be there after using Duplicate. The duplicate is placed directly on top of the original.
### Paste
To paste an object from the clipboard click "Paste" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl - V". This will place a copy of the clipboard contents in the current file. Note that LightBurn can paste text or images copied to the clipboard from other software.
### Paste in place
To paste an object from the clipboard click "Paste in place" in the Edit menu or press "Alt - V". This will place a copy of the clipboard contents in the current file in the same spot that it was in the original file. 
### Delete
To delete an object select it and click "Delete" in the Edit menu, or hit the Delete key.  This will remove the object from the current file.
### Convert to path
This converts a built-in "shape" object, like a rectangle, ellipse, or text, into lines and curves that can be edited. Click on "Convert to path" in the Edit menu. The original shape information is lost, so you won't be able to change text with the text tool after using this.
### Close path 
In order to "Scan" (Fill) a shape with your laser, the shape must be a closed loop, where the starting and ending point are the same.  If the start and end points are very close, but not quite connected, "Close Path" will move them together.  Click on "Close path" in the Edit menu or press "Alt + C"
### Auto join selected shapes
Looks at the start and end points of all the selected curves, and if any of them are close enough, connects them together into a single shape. Useful when importing DXF files, which don't contain connectivity information. Click on "Auto join selected shapes" in the Edit menu or press "Alt + J"
### Optimize Selected Shapes
Attempts to fit the selected shapes to arcs and lines within a specified error tolerance. Useful for reducing the point count in a shape, or recovering arcs from software that exports them as many small line segments.
### Delete Duplicates
This will delete duplicate items within the drawing, for example if two squares are identical and one on top of the other, this will delete the extra square. This helps to minimize erroneous moves and double-cuts.
### Select Open shapes
This will select all open shapes in the document.
### Select open shapes set to scan
This will select all the open shapes that are set to scan in the document.
### Select all shapes in current layer
This will select all the shapes that are set to cut in the current layer of the document. Note that if some of these shapes are grouped, the system may have to un-group them in order to select them.
### Settings
Clicking on "Settings" in the Edit menu will open a [Dialog box](Settings.md) where you can enter information about your laser and default application settings.
### Device Settings
After initial setup, you can access device settings by choosing "[Device Settings](DeviceSettings.md)".
### Machine Settings
You can access the controller hardware settings by choosing this option.
### Debug drawing
This is mostly an internal tool for LightBurn developers that shows the bounds of shapes being drawn.
### Convert to cut
Also an internal tool for LightBurn developers - It converts the selected shapes into the cuts that would be sent to the laser, and makes a new shape from the result.
This is not how you produce gcode / cuts for your machine, it's just a debugging tool. Click on "Convert to cut" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + Shift + C"
